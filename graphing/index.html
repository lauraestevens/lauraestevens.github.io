<h2>What is QL?</h2>
<p>Quantitative literacy (QL) comprises all the skills that go into applying math concepts and logic to real-world problems: logical reasoning, data gathering, and data communication, to name a few (<a href="#miller">Miller 2010</a>). Deep QL involves a great deal of comfort with math and statistics, and that may only be achieved by scientists and mathematicians who live and breathe data. But at least some level of QL is important skill to develop for scientists and laypeople alike. The contributors to <em>Mathematics and Democracy</em> (<a href="#steen">Steen et al. 2001</a>) give many examples of the need for QL in daily life: can you keep track of your finances? Can you understand how taxes work? Can you distinguish between correlation and causation? (Quick side note: <em>Mathematics and Democracy</em> is a pretty outstanding book!)</p>

<p>And this past year has given us a stark example of the broad importance of QL: consider the number of COVID graphs we've had to look at since last March. Many of these graphs used a logarithmic scale to handle the rapidly accelerating rates of transmission and the huge numbers of infected and dead. But without understanding what a logarithmic scale is and why it is used, people reading these graphs may believe&mdash;or be led to believe&mdash;that the pandemic has been less deadly and less impactful than it truly is. So, good QL can even be seen as a public health issue. It is, at the very least, integral to becoming an informed, involved citizen, and is therefore an essential skill to teach high schoolers before they go out into the world.</p>

<p>Even so, students do not spend a great deal of time working with numbers outside of math classes (<a href="#miller">Miller 2010</a>), and the way mathematics is taught is not necessarily to achieve numeracy (i.e., comfort and intuition with numbers and data) but to prepare students for college math (<a href="#steen">Steen et al. 2001 p. 5</a>). The assumption may be that because students are learning pieces of QL in each of their classes&mdash;data gathering in science, function manipulation in math, writing in English&mdash;they will be able to synthesize and transfer these skills between classes. But this is seem to be the case: students need practice with transfering and applying their skills (<a href="#steen">Steen et al. 2001, p.95</a>). If we only teach graphing in math class, and we only teach writing in English, why should students assume that these skills can be useful together? </p>

<p>So, my project focuses on helping 9th graders develop their QL, specifically with respect to graphing. It's a great age to start getting them to think a little more laterally, and to help them decompartmentalize their knowledge. The students were very capable graphers in a pure math context: they could tell me what y = mx + b means; they could set up axes and tell me which quadrants were which; they could visually ID quadratic functions. But transferring those skills to science was a real bear for them!</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is some really interesting work on QL for high schoolers! One of the big takeaways for me was that writing is essential to developing QL. <a href="#grawe">Grawe et al. (2010)</a>, <a href="#miller">Miller (2010)</a>, and <a href="#grawe2">Rutz and Grawe (2009)</a> all focus on writing as a necessary component of teaching QL, because if students cannot articulate what they're seeing in the graph, then they don't really grok it. And developing students' abilities to communicate in the context of a science classroom is something that needs to be intentionally done, because writing for English isn't the same as writing for science. <a href="#shanas">The Shanahans (2009)</a> have a great article on just how different reading and writing can be between disciplines, because the disciplines themselves, their purposes and goals, are so varied. They find that content-area teachers need to teach discipline-specific literacy by focusing on the strategies we use when reading discipline-specific texts. So, when I read a science paper, how do I read it? What do I look for? How does that translate to writing a lab report or making a presentation?</p>

<p>So I'm going to address those ideas as I teach my students about reading and making graphs. I'll go into some more detail below, but one of the focal points for the last bit of our time together was to produce written analysis statements of graphs &mdash; essentially, writing figure captions or writing an explanation suitable for a presentation. This piece incorporates both the writing aspect that Grawe, Miller, and so many others have found is essential, and provides an opportunity to talk about science reading and writing.</p>

<h3>Intervention and Assessment</h3>
<p>My intervention took a two-pronged approach, with direct instruction and quantitative communication practice. We incorporated graphing into seven different assignments, including labs, reports, and classroom assignments. After every couple assignments, I picked two or three aspects of the graphs produced that most students struggled with, and I discussed them with students in the form of a direct instruction lecture that usually took around five minutes. </p>

<p class="caption">First deployment of intervention! After our first graphing assignment, Ocean Floor Profiles. If you're having trouble viewing the video, you should be able to watch it <a href="https://youtu.be/ZazXLGS1a_0">here.</a></p>

<p>Each graphing assignment included some aspects of analysis through writing, but some were especially communication-heavy. The Deposition Lab, Earthquake Presentation, and Paleo Portfolio assignments all included a lab report or presentation in which graphs were the central feature. We coached students on writing thorough analysis statements and communicating their findings.</p>

<p>My assessment used the standard pre/post format (copies of the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17_zclBZrkWAFaC-ELGmyY_DMBVHwJGzP28nGrE6pqKs/edit?usp=sharing">pre-</a> and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1y-HMRikikgyxclxZiPnU3eMEuX0Ab62DVJ3YwUUe3rA/edit?usp=sharing">post-assessments</a> are available). Both assessments included identical sections for students to self-score their confidence with different graphing skills; in other areas, they differed:
<ul>
<li>The pre-assessment included a section to gauge students' perception of the purpose of graphing.</li>
<li>The post-assessment included a question to ascertain the students' math level</li>
<li>The post-assessment included an analysis statement question</li>
<li>While both assessments included graph analysis/interp questions focusing on the same skills, the questions themselves differed.</li>
</ul>

<p>After looking at the assessments, I chose four students whose work I would look at in more depth. I chose the two students with the largest jumps in overall confidence, and the two students with the largest drops in overall confidence.</p>

<h2 id="reflection">Reflection</h2>
<p>Obviously, I wish my intervention had been a rousing success: that students were able to look at any graph and begin to dissect and analyze it and just juice all the info out of it. And that did not happen. Why?</p>

<p>Well, for one, that's an absurdly optimistic expectation to have for six weeks of an intervention that addresses something other than content knowledge. But I think the intervention yielded mixed results for a few reasons. </p>

<dl>
<dt>Not enough time:</dt> <dd>Six weeks is not a lot of time! Especially when we're trying to weave an intervention into a pre-existing curriculum.</dd>
<dt>IT'S A FLIPPIN PANDEMIC:</dt> <dd>Students were in and out; our curriculum had to be abbreviated and adhered to closely; there wasn't a great deal of flexibility.</dd>
<dt>Not enough labs:<dt> <dd>We had one lab where students gathered their own data.<dd>
</dl>

The lab aspect is really important. It's hands-on learning for QL, and that's why PBL is such a big movement: doing &rarr; learning, and learning really deeply. <a href="#roth">Roth and Bowen (1999)</a> describe an outstanding group of eight graders who built their QL through tons of field and lab work, and these kids have just amazing conversations as they wrestle with the data they gathered:
<blockquote>
<p>Jamie: We have to figure it out right now, the pattern.</p>
<p>Miles: If you look at it though that’s the [area with] low [pH]. It starts off, that’s kind of, that’s the [area with the] lowest [pH], that’s the [area with the] highest pH, and that is the lowest, and if you look at this, it has this is the highest pH.</p>
<p>Jamie: So the pH is chosen [by the plants].</p>
<p>Miles: The closest to neutral 18.9 [cm average height], then the one [area] with the lowest pH has 21.5 [cm average height]; it has 16 May apples; then the one with the medium one has 20 cm. So it looks like the pattern.</p>
<p>Jamie: Looks like the pH.</p>
<p>Miles: It looks like the pH, the lower the pH.</p>
<p>Jamie: The higher it grows.</p>
<p>Miles: Well, it doesn’t really mean, like we could express it in that way though; because I bet if it had a one pH [pH = 1], it wouldn’t grow at all. It would just be the acid. So you can’t say, so there is no way that you can say, the lower the pH is the more growth.</p>
</blockquote>

That level of conversation would have been great to observe with my students during their Deposition labs or Earthquake projects, but the weirdness of this year means that the students haven't had the opportunity to do as many labs as they would in a normal year. 

<p>And here's just a spitballin' hypothesis: I think we also have to keep expectations for deep thought and productive struggle really consistent over the entire educational experience. When students move from one class to another, it's like there's this threshold effect where they move from one set of expectations to another, and are surprised when they're asked to dig deep in period 2 even though they were digging deep in period 1. There's a physical compartmentalization that translates to a mental compartmentalization.</p>

<p>Plus, there's a risk to productive struggle: <em>people will see you struggle.</em> And that's terrifying for everyone, but especially for teenagers. So maybe it's not so much a compartmentalization issue, but rather being in a new place where you don't feel so safe putting yourself out there. And six weeks isn't enough time to get kids feeling safe in that way. My cooperating teacher said that by quarter 3 in a normal year, students are volunteering their best guesses left and right, but this year it was a real struggle, just because of the amount of remote learning and general instability.</p>

<p>Speaking of compartmentalization: I wish we'd had more opportunities to write during this intervention. I started with these big, exciting plans after my initial literature search, and these are plans I will remember when I'm in charge of my own classroom. I had hoped to get students writing analysis statements very early on, and that just didn't pan out. By the end of the six weeks, some students could articulate what they were seeing in their graphs, but many still struggled. </p>

<p>Some of this, I think, is a practice issue: they didn't get a lot of practice in their six weeks with me, and they don't have a lot of practice writing for science. I attempted to implement the recommendations that the <a href="#shanas">Shanahans (2009)</a> gave, and focus on the strategies I use when reading science papers or preparing presentations. I wrote some guiding questions for analysis statements, did some coaching, offered some examples and non-examples. But I can think of lots of other ways to reinforce those ideas, and that could potentially improve this intervention. For instance, maybe starting every day with a figure/caption pair from Real Papers and have the students TPS as a bellringer could be a way to squeeze lots of practice into an already packed course.</p>

<p>In the end, I learned a lot about how I want to approach QL and science writing in my classroom, so that's a win. And my students did learn plenty about graphing, even if they haven't mastered it yet. These results definitely aren't publication worthy, but they do give me a lot to think about and build on!</p>
