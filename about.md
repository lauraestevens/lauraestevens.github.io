title: About This Site
---
I lovingly hand-coded this website myself! (you know, if you're looking for someone to teach web design...)

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) gave me some infrastructure to combine HTML and Markdown and make my life easier.
- [Colormind](http://colormind.io) let me extract a color scheme from my Darwin photo and [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com) let me check for accessible contrast.
- Google Fonts let me embed some nice webfonts and ensure they display correctly in your browser. Titles are in Roboto Slab and body text is in Roboto.
