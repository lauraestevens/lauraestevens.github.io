title: About This Site
---
I lovingly hand-coded this website myself. 

I used <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> for the framework. If you're familiar with HTML/CSS and Markdown, and don't want to do a lot of copy/pasting of repeated elements, Jekyll is _very much_ for you! It's free under the MIT license!

I used <a href="http://colormind.io" target="_blank">Colormind</a> for the color scheme. It's an awesome tool that generates web-friendly color schemes, and can also produce schemes based on images (which is what I did for this, using my Darwin photo). 

Finally, I used <a href="http://fonts.google.com" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a> for the type. Titles are in Roboto Slab and body text is in Roboto.
