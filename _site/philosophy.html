<h1>Classroom Management Philosophy</h1>
<p>To sum up my classroom management philosophy: provide structure, clear deadlines, and organization, be positive and roll with the punches, and teach my students to do the same.</p>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>I’m getting my teaching license while also getting an MS in Geosciences, and I’ve been thinking a lot about structure, because grad school has approximately zero structure, and I miss it so much. I would really have benefitted from more hard deadlines and tough love from my adviser, so as a teacher, I want to make sure I provide that for my students. Having that structure around lets students focus more on their actual learning, rather than all the organizational peripherals to learning. And as a teacher, I also will want some structure, because I do not want chaos with a hundred kids’ worth of late assignments.</p>

<p>I think a clear routine with direct instruction is ideal, and lots of methods to streamline all the administrativia would be awesome. I want to teach physics, and there is no good way to teach or learn physics that doesn’t involve a ton of diligent work, because it’s lots of new math and lots of new science. So the longer we can spend doing the hard work of learning, the better. But that means that we’ll have to establish some really clear routines and procedures, so we can quickly get down to business.</p>

<p>I taught physics for a year right after undergrad, and I was so lax about deadlines and late work, because my outlook at that point was, “As long as you do the work, then you’ll learn, so better late than never.” And while most of my students did do their work on time, a couple just turned in everything way late. Like end-of-year late. After giving it some thought, I realized those students probably fell into one of two camps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>They didn’t really care about physics, so there’s no intrinsic motivation to get the work done.</li>
  <li>They had a hard time with planning, organization, and executive function.</li>
</ol>

<p>If a student falls into camp 1, then they’re wrong, of course, but that’s really more my problem than theirs. I can’t make them care about physics, but I can find ways to motivate them. That’s my one job. And if a student falls into camp 2, then it’s incumbent upon me to help them develop their planning and organization skills. If I fail to do that, I’m letting them down.</p>

<p>So either way, this means I need to get mean about deadlines. That’s the kind of unfun structure that I don’t really look forward to providing, but I know I have to.</p>

<h2 id="encouragement-and-feedback">Encouragement and Feedback</h2>
<p>I’m also constantly thinking about encouragement procedures, because that’s a big deal in physics: tons of the physics education research out there is just about motivating kids to take physics and to stay in physics. I want to get my kids comfortable failing publicly, because that’s just part of the deal. They will have to do problems on the board and they will mess up. And I will mess up too, because public math in the morning is a recipe for disaster. So I’ll model graceful, instructive failure, because that’s built into the job. I also want to incorporate intentional practices to get my students okay with putting themselves out there and risking failure, but I don’t know what that would be yet.</p>

<p>I’m big into private praise, because that way I can be honest and specific about what I’m seeing from students without letting everyone else in on anyone’s private business. So, if a student was having a terrible time with conservation of momentum problems, and then does well on their homework, I can give them feedback specific to that without making it a public event.</p>

<p>Like <a href="http://www.safeandcivilschools.com/services/classroom_management.php" target="_blank">Sprick and friends</a>, I am also all about specific feedback, be it positive, negative, or neutral. Specificity makes praise about a student’s accomplishments rather than pleasing the teacher, and I think it makes the negative interactions more akin to gentle corrections, and therefore more palatable to a student.</p>

<p>Every mid-quarter and end-of-quarter, I might do student conferences where I make sure I find genuine, positive stuff to note for everyone. Not sure when I would do that (maybe while students are busy with independent work, I guess?) but I definitely want to do mini performance reviews—especially mid-quarter so students have time to turn things around if they need to.</p>

<p>I tend toward the wildly enthusiastic when lecturing, and I’m big into rewarding successful struggle, so I foresee a lot of high fives. And successful struggle is, I think, its own reward. You worked really hard and it paid off.</p>
