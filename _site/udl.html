<h1>UDL</h1>
<p>When we talk about multiple methods for engagement, for representation, and for expression, we’re really talking about making education accessible and equitable. It’s really an issue of justice. So for me, UDL <em>is</em> teaching. It’s just what teaching should be. If some method of engagement doesn’t work for some of your students, you try a different method! And if something feels obvious to you, that doesn’t mean that’s true for everyone—and it’s a teacher’s job to reach <em>everyone.</em></p>

<p>So here are a few UDL-appropriate strategies I plan to use in my classroom.</p>

<h2 id="for-goal-setting--executive-function">For goal-setting &amp; executive function:</h2>
<h3 id="give-them-the-goals">Give them the goals!</h3>
<p>Tell students what we’re working toward, and help them practice figuring that out for themselves. In my pre-service field experience, I sat in on an eighth-grade physical science class the day they began a new unit, and their teacher projected the standards they were addressing on the board and guided the students as they dissected them. What did each term mean? What did they already know about those terms? What did they think they’d need to learn about them? What steps would they take to do that? It took most of the class to do, but those students knew <em>exactly</em> what they’d be spending the next month of their life learning. I am going to start every unit with this exercise.</p>

<h3 id="science-notebooks-as-agendas">Science Notebooks as agendas</h3>
<p>Again, <a href="https://www.wgu.edu/heyteach/article/guide-implementing-science-notebooks1802.html">science notebooks</a> come in clutch! Students can have a part of each day’s pages (maybe right at the beginning) set aside for assignments due. Science notebooks are meant to be checked — so I can come around and check to make sure students have their assingments down.</p>

<p>During student teaching, I worked with a lot of kids who needed extra executive function and planning support, and I really think agenda checks are a good way to go. I do not care how old you are: it’s always good to check to make sure you have everything down. Eventually, students can start asking me if they’ve got everything, rather than the other way around — a great way to get kids advocating for themselves!</p>

<h2 id="for-comprehension">For comprehension:</h2>
<h3 id="direct-instruction">Direct instruction!</h3>
<p>Looking at the <a href="http://udlguidelines.cast.org/representation/comprehension" target="_blank">official UDL guidelines for providing options for comprehension</a>, everything appears to suggest direct instruction. I know that that’s not always en vogue with the science curriculum crowd, and I strongly suspect that this is is because most of these folks’ most recent experience with direct instruction was a university professor droning at a blackboard. But direct instruction does not preclude students getting a lab and getting their hands dirty. It doesn’t preclude learning from experience! It doesn’t even mean I <em>never</em> have to do PBL! It just means we have to clearly and directly provide the scaffolding students need to make sense of that experiential learning.</p>

<p>This means I will need to design lessons with …</p>
<ul>
  <li>… consistent language use with careful introduction of synonyms.</li>
  <li>… special attention paid to confusing concepts, especially those with closely related terminology (e.g. meiosis and mitosis)</li>
  <li>… concepts explained to students using language; models and illustrations; examples and nonexamples.</li>
  <li>… lots of opportunities to probe for feedback.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="for-perception-and-recruiting-interest">For perception and recruiting interest</h2>
<h3 id="lots-of-different-methods-of-information-transferboth-from-me-and-from-my-students">Lots of different methods of information transfer—both from me and from my students!</h3>
<p>Students with auditory impairments can’t rely solely on a verbal lecture; students with visual impairments can’t rely solely on slideshows—I need to be responsive and flexible in how I present information so that I can meet all my students needs! Plus, presenting information in the same way every day may create a reliable routine, but will also be very boring. Meanwhile, presenting the <em>same</em> information in <em>multiple</em> ways gives everyone a chance to engage with the material, and gives more opportunity for students to consider an idea from multiple perspectives.</p>

<p>And when students are able to tell me what they know in a way that works best for them and resonates with their interests, I’ll be better able to tell whether they got it, and they’ll have more fun learning! They’ll be more engaged and they’ll learn more. So for big projects, I’ll provide a few options for products students can give me, and they can choose how they want to show me what they’ve learned. For smaller projects, I may have everyone do the same thing (with appropriate modifications for students who need them) but I’ll try to make each small project something novel.</p>
