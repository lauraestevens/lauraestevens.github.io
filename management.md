title: Classroom Management
---
To sum up my classroom management practice: provide structure, clear deadlines, and organization, be positive and roll with the punches, and teach my students to do the same.

## Structure
A clear routine with direct instruction is ideal, and methods to streamline recordkeeping and administration are essential. One subject I love to teach is physics, and there is no good way to teach or learn physics that doesn’t involve a ton of diligent work, because it’s lots of new math and lots of new science. So the longer we can spend doing the hard work of learning, the better. That means that we have to establish some really clear routines and procedures, so we can quickly get down to business. Bell ringers and exit tickets, biweekly check-ins, and guided notes are all strategies I have used to provide predictable rhythm to a class. 

Deadlines, in particular, are an interesting challenge as we navigate post-pandemic learning. During the dark days of entirely remote learning, deadlines were gentle suggestions and many students continue to readjust to the idea of due dates; at the same time, LMSs allow us to set late penalties imposed every *hour*. Currently, I teach primarily college freshmen, meaning I have students coming in with secondary experiences ranging the full gamut between both of those extremes. 

I assume that all my students are human beings (although given my research background in exoplanets and astrobiology I would be very excited to learn otherwise). Deadlines are necessary. So is grace. Here is my late policy. 

>I will accept late work with no penalty up to one week after the due date. After that, I will not accept the work at all — unless you have contacted me beforehand to let me know that you need more time; then, you can turn your work in by the newly-negotiated due date at no penalty.
>This policy may also be modified if there are extenuating circumstances: that is, if you have work more than a week late that you want to make up, but you haven’t contacted me about it, contact me about it. Then we can discuss options that work best for your situation.

Depending on what my students need, I may offer/require specific methods of recordkeeping and organization, like using <a href="https://www.calacademy.org/educators/science-notebook-corner">science notebooks</a>. I notice that students are fairly tied to the LMS as a way to manage due dates and keep on top of their grades, and while I mostly think that this is a recipe for anxiety, I also realize that ship has sailed, and supplementing that reality with a compassionate late policy can be a good way for students to use digital tools to manage their calendars. 

## Encouragement and Failure
Struggling and failure are essential to learning, and the aspect of learning that students hate the most. So I need to provide students with the right amount of encouragement and structure to let them feel psychologically safe. 

I want to get my kids comfortable with failure, including public failure, because that’s part of being a human being. Students will have to do problems on the board and they will mess up. And I will mess up too, because public math in the morning is a recipe for disaster. So I’ll model graceful, instructive failure, because that’s built into the job. 

I also incorporate intentional practices to get my students okay with putting themselves out there and risking failure. Especially at the beginning of the semester, I try to rely more on semi-structured volunteering --- for example, having students break into small groups and letting each group choose a spokesperson before calling on a group at random. As students realize that getting out there and guessing is actually productive rather than world-ending, it gets a lot easier for them, and they start volunteering their best guesses. 

All of this small-scale exposure to failure leads to our ultimate goal: students who can design their own experiments, gather data, and do science on their own. They may not feel confident about it at first, but every day they will be learning the importance of guessing and failing, and how integral it is to the process of science. Project-based learning is the ultimate culmination of that, and while I don't believe that good science teaching should be entirely PBL (nor should it be entirely direct instruction), it is still an essential component. And it's an incredibly empowering component, as long as students aren't immediately thrown into the deep end. 

With any project-based work, group work is key. Especially for long-term projects, working in a group can do wonders for students' psychological safety as they build relationships with each other. But even small think-pair-share activities, brief break-out groups to work through some sample problems, and minute-long brainstorming sessions are all ways to get students to talk to each other, get comfortable with each other, and get comfortable sharing with each other.

## Feedback 
I’m big into private praise, because that way I can be honest and specific about what I’m seeing from students without letting everyone else in on anyone’s private business. So, if a student was having a terrible time with conservation of momentum problems, and then does well on their homework, I can give them feedback specific to that without making it a public event. (Or I can make it a public event if they seem like the kind of student who would like that!)

Like <a href="http://www.safeandcivilschools.com/services/classroom_management.php" target="_blank">Sprick and friends</a>, I am also big into specific feedback, be it positive, negative, or neutral. Specificity makes praise about a student's accomplishments rather than pleasing the teacher, and I think it makes the negative interactions more akin to gentle corrections, and therefore more palatable to a student.

I tend toward the wildly enthusiastic when lecturing, and I’m big into rewarding successful struggle. I'm a prolific giver of high-fives and candy. And successful struggle is, I think, its own reward. You worked really hard and it paid off. 

## Classroom Rules
I strongly believe that students should participate in making classroom rules! But I do have some specific norms are non-negotiable for me: 

1. **Be present:** pay attention and take notes during lecture; work only on what our class is doing today. 
2. **Be curious:** ask questions when you are confused, and volunteer answers, even if you are not sure they are correct.
3. **Be excellent to each other:** respect each others’ space and belongings; respect each other as you learn; encourage and help one another.
4. **Respect the struggle:** this is the crucible in which your science mind is forming. It will be so hard. You can do this. 

I expect to be teaching a wide range of ages over my career, anything from middle school life science to AP physics. So _how_ I teach these rules will depend a lot on their ages. For younger ages, we can spend some time on the first day discussing what these rules mean, giving examples and non-examples of following each rule. For older students, I will go through these on day one, ask if there are questions and make any clarifications, but that will be it as far as directly addressing the rules.

After that, I will teach by modeling and by correction. We all know what the rules are, but learning how to play by them will require trial and error. 

So, for my correction methods: for small problems --- side talk or really any violation of rule #1 --- I like proximity for a first strike and a verbal redirection for a second. For cumulative small problems, time owed is appealing. 

I’m happy to handle minor disruptions that aren’t targeted at anyone, and for a first or second infraction with a student who is disrespectful to another student, I’d handle that in-house as well. I can keep a roster on my desk and make tickmarks; after three strikes, your parents are getting a call. 

For behavior that seems outside the scope of the natural tumultuousness of teenagerhood, I’d want to have an after-class or after-school talk, just to figure out what’s going on. I don’t necessarily expect the students to be super honest or forthcoming, because that requires that the student make themselves vulnerable and they may not be willing to do that. But some gentle probes could still be revealing, even if the student doesn’t totally unburden themselves. 

Other than that, I think how I handle problematic behavior will have to depend a lot on where I’m teaching and who I’m working with. Every time I start at a new school, I’m going to sit down with the administrators and with the counselor and get an idea of who I’m going to be working with and what kinds of considerations I’m going to have to take into account. Humans aren't one-size-fits-all, so rules can't be, either!
