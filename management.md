title: Classroom Management
---
To sum up my classroom management practice: provide structure, clear deadlines, and organization, be positive and roll with the punches, and teach my students to do the same.

## Structure
I finished my teaching program while also getting an MS in Geosciences, which served to crystallize my thoughts on the value of structure, because grad school has approximately none. 

A clear routine with direct instruction is ideal, and methods to streamline recordkeeping and administration are essential. One subject I love to teach is physics, and there is no good way to teach or learn physics that doesn’t involve a ton of diligent work, because it’s lots of new math and lots of new science. So the longer we can spend doing the hard work of learning, the better. But that means that we’ll have to establish some really clear routines and procedures, so we can quickly get down to business. 

I taught physics for a year right after undergrad, and I didn't closely enforce deadlines and late work, because my outlook at that point was, “As long as you do the work, then you’ll learn, so better late than never.” And while most of my students did do their work on time, a couple just turned in everything *way* late. After giving it some thought, I realized those students probably fell into one of two camps:
1. They didn't really care about physics, so they didn't have the intrinsic motivation to get the work done.
2. They had a hard time with planning, organization, and executive function. 

If a student falls into camp 1, I need to find ways to motivate them. That’s my job. And if a student falls into camp 2, then it's incumbent upon me to help them develop their planning and organization skills. If I fail to do that, I'm letting them down. 

So either way, this means I need to get consistent and serious about deadlines. It also means I can offer my students specific methods of recordkeeping and organization, like using <a href="https://www.calacademy.org/educators/science-notebook-corner">science notebooks</a>.

## Encouragement and Failure
Struggling and failure are essential to learning, and the aspect of learning that students hate the most. So I need to provide students with the right amount of encouragement and structure to let them feel psychologically safe. 

I want to get my kids comfortable with failure, including public failure, because that’s part of being a human being. Students will have to do problems on the board and they will mess up. And I will mess up too, because public math in the morning is a recipe for disaster. So I’ll model graceful, instructive failure, because that’s built into the job. 
I also incorporate intentional practices to get my students okay with putting themselves out there and risking failure. Especially at the beginning of the semester, I try to rely more on semi-structured volunteering --- for example, having students break into small groups and letting each group choose a spokesperson before calling on a group at random. As students realize that getting out there and guessing is actually productive rather than world-ending, it gets a lot easier for them, and they start volunteering their best guesses. 

All of this small-scale exposure to failure leads to our ultimate goal: students who can design their own experiments, gather data, and do science on their own. They may not feel confident about it at first, but every day they will be learning the importance of guessing and failing, and how integral it is to the process of science. Project-based learning is the ultimate culmination of that, and while I don't believe that good science teaching should be entirely PBL (nor should it be entirely direct instruction), it is still an essential component. And it's an incredibly empowering component, as long as students aren't immediately thrown into the deep end. 

With any project-based work, group work is key. Especially for long-term projects, working in a group can do wonders for students' psychological safety as they build relationships with each other. But even small think-pair-share activities, brief break-out groups to work through some sample problems, and minute-long brainstorming sessions are all ways to get students to talk to each other, get comfortable with each other, and get comfortable sharing with each other.

## Feedback 
I’m big into private praise, because that way I can be honest and specific about what I’m seeing from students without letting everyone else in on anyone’s private business. So, if a student was having a terrible time with conservation of momentum problems, and then does well on their homework, I can give them feedback specific to that without making it a public event. Or I can make it a public event if they seem like the kind of student who would like that!

Like <a href="http://www.safeandcivilschools.com/services/classroom_management.php" target="_blank">Sprick and friends</a>, I am also big into specific feedback, be it positive, negative, or neutral. Specificity makes praise about a student's accomplishments rather than pleasing the teacher, and I think it makes the negative interactions more akin to gentle corrections, and therefore more palatable to a student.

I tend toward the wildly enthusiastic when lecturing, and I’m big into rewarding successful struggle. I'm a prolific giver of high-fives and candy. And successful struggle is, I think, its own reward. You worked really hard and it paid off.
