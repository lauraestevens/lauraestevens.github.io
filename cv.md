# Experience
## Lab Specialist
2021-Present
Physics Department, Gonzaga University
Teaching the lab for PHYS 104: Scientific Inquiry. The lab component of this course explores epistemology and the process of doing science. Students learn how to gather data, how to analyze their data using statistics and linear regression, how to report and explain uncertainty, and how to build and test mathematical models. 

- Prepare students for the week's lab with a pre-lab lecture. 
- Facilitate a lab with open, drop-in hours. 
- Develop new materials and modified previously existing materials. 

## Teaching Assistant
2018-2020
University of Montana, Missoula, MT
Taught the introductory geoscience lab for both majors and non-majors. 
- Prepared students with a mini-lecture introducing new concepts and connecting back to their regular lecture.
- Facilitated weekly lab activities including chemical and physical testing of rocks and minerals, mapping activities, and modeling earth system dynamics.

## Freelance Script Writer
2017-2021
SciShow Space
Wrote scripts for SciShow Space, an educational YouTube channel. 
- Pitched and developed video ideas.
- Summarized new research for a public audience.
- Communicated science to the public in, hopefully, an engaging way.
