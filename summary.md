title: Summary and Takeaways
---
Oh my goodness, Dr. Blakely, this was an amazing semester. It has been just an incredible experience since day one, when I met my boyfriend for dinner after class and told him I was leaving him for you. He was very understanding about it. 

I'd say the overarching theme of this class was really about how to act on your compassion. We're all here because we care about kids and we care about learning, but how we specifically do that, and do that consistently for all students, is not always obvious, and involves rolling with the punches a _lot._ And self-educating _**a lot**_: there are so many ways to live, so many ways to interact with the world, and I have to be ready to meet all my students where they are. 

And, less fun but wildly necessary, is sometimes you gotta be the bad guy. Enforcing rules and structure is not fun. But being the adult in the room means not always being fun. It means being there, being stable, and being trustworthy. And I think that will be my biggest challenge, because I always want to give my students the benefit of the doubt, give them some leeway, give them a pass just this once. But that makes me untrustworthy. If I can't be trusted to carry out the consequences to my own rules, I can't be trusted, period. No one benefits from that. 

Okay, so now I'm going to go grab my soapbox and megaphone from the Accommodations section because my other big takeaways need them for maximum effect.

I learned that direct instruction is truly the tits, regardless of whatever happens to be trendy in education. That seems to be a thing in education, where well-meaning administrators get all hot-and-bothered about something flashy that they heard about on NPR, like discovery learning. "They'll learn science by experimenting! How cool is that!" No! Not cool! Because they don't know what they're doing!

The year that I taught was the year that that _Grit_ book* came out. Good lord. Malcom Gladwell lost his shit over it (as he does all non-fiction books with one-word titles, I assume) so our administrators made us have a whole PD day about it. We were supposed to teach grit? Which was easy enough for me because I taught college-level** algebra-based physics to students who were just starting Algebra II, where the teachers were made to use a discovery learning curriculum. So it was like, "Get used to failure, kids! Let's have fun!"

That's another soapbox thing for me, that experimentation with your students' learning regardless of what the data says works. I ended up running my classes with a pretty standard direct instruction approach: bellringer, lecture, practice, regroup. They learned physics. To be honest, I didn't think about it being direct instruction or not; because I was so inexperienced all I could do was just rely on my instincts, and that's just what happened. I guess I learned a lot from experience, and say what you will about Catholic school, but they _definitely_ don't play around with PBL there. And now that I actually know (kind of, a little) what I'm doing, I can really use DI with purpose, and teach my students even better. 

This leads me to another big takeaway. There is a _ton_ that a teacher can do to ... shield their students from the fallout of a poorly-managed school. But a really consistently good education comes from teachers who can manage their classrooms, and administrators who can manage their schools. Hearing about Hellgate compared to my teaching experience, or my boyfriend's educational experience at other schools which I shall not name, and I'm just blown away with how much more effectively things seem to be run over there. This class has really made me much more aware of the whole educational ecosystem, which makes me so much more prepared to advocate for my students---and for myself. When I quit that teaching job, the curriculum coordinator told me not to feel bad because half of all teachers quit before year three. She didn't seem to think that was a problem, just a fact of life. I feel much better prepared to tactfully confront future administrators now, and I feel much better armed against burnout.

<p class="caption" style="text-align:left;">** They told me to teach at that level, and then said, "Teach to the top 20% and the remaining 80% will fail or switch schools." They also didn't realize that you needed to have learned all of high-school math to succeed in college physics. </p>
