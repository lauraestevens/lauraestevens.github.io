I"K&<p>This is one of <em>the most important</em> things for me. I am <em>so serious</em> about educational accessibility. Like, I start getting angry about it. It’s a civil rights issue! We can’t just ignore the <em>rights of children</em>! Of <em><strong>children!</strong></em></p>

<p>…. Okay. I’m better now. Here are some ways to approach students with learning disabilities or other special educational needs. Because I’ll be teaching science, my focus will be on accommodating students in science classes, and because physics is so math-intensive, math learning disabilities and math anxiety is a special interest of mine.</p>

<h2 id="math-ld-manipulatives">Math LD: Manipulatives</h2>
<p>All students learning any math will benefit from manipulatives, or objects used to represent mathematical concepts. These can be as simple as beans reprensenting numbers, to 3D-printed projections of extradimensional shapes. They are essentially math’s answer to models in science: think of the ball-and-stick models of chemical compounds.</p>

<p>Manipulatives have been shown to provide <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1540-5826.00067?casa_token=_PanHH0eg0wAAAAA%3AKvqG2zSFbis4UQWJKNs9GkVpHJFBSpFfZjdi9PRrSt5abrlG39FdvxVir3gR16Cg-FHRDL3vus4vPLhG" target="_blank">long-term gains in mathematical ability</a>; however, using them effectively requires extra effort from
teachers, and may even require special training or meeting with a specialist.</p>

<p>For instance, students with math LD tend to have difficulty subitizing, or breaking
quantities down into groups. So, if a student presented with two
groups of five beans, they would need to count each individual bean to say that there are
ten there. It is not enough to present them with two groups of five beans, to give them
manipulatives; how that lesson is run, and how the knowledge is assessed and reinforced, is
the most important factor.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are a great deal of resources to make manipulative use accessible and widespread. The
companies that make the manipulatives have lesson plans to accompany them, and
websites like <a href="https://mathforlove.com/" target="_blank">Math for Love</a> and <a href="https://www.nctm.org/" target="_blank">National Council of Teachers of Mathematics</a>
have further resources on theory and implementation. There are manipulatives that look
like money; there are manipulatives designed specifically to teach place value, fractions,
addition, and subtraction; there are virtual manipulatives, such as <a href="https://www.nctm.org/">NumberBeads</a>, in which students can drag, drop, slice, and meld strings of beads to
develop their ability to subitize.</p>

<p>Because of the wide variety of manipulatives, there is no
one way to implement them, so it is important that teachers familiarize themselves with
the specific manipulatives they plan to use and are conscientious as they plan their lessons
with them. Whatever my students’ specific needs are, I’d look into finding a manipulative that can help make these abstract concepts concrete for them.</p>

<h2 id="math-anxiety-mindfulness-and-breathing-exercises">Math Anxiety: Mindfulness and Breathing Exercises</h2>

<p>Students with math LD can struggle not just academically, but also emotionally. They can
develop math anxiety because general
education math classes do not meet their needs, and so they consistently underperform.
In his <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.357.4284&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">article on math LD in Child Neuropsychology: <em>Concepts, Theory, and Practice</em></a>, Brian Butterworth included interviews with 9-year-olds with math LD about their experiences
in math class:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Child 5: It makes me feel left out, sometimes.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Child 2: Yeah.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Child 5: When I like—when I don’t know something, I wish that I was like a
clever person and I blame it on myself—</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Child 4: I could cry and wish I was at home with my mum and it would be—I
won’t have to do any maths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And while math anxiety very frequently co-occurs with math LD, there are many students with no learning disabilities who still struggle with math anxiety. Every student deserves equal access to a math education that works for them, and addressing the needs of people with learning disabilities or anxiety is already an issue of equity: neurotypical students are not the only people whose needs must be met. But that issue goes even deeper when one realizes that a student’s math anxiety may be borne out of stereotype threat, which is the sense of anxiety one experiences when they’re worried about playing into a stereotype.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.xkcd.com/385/" target="_blank"><img src="assets/img/how_it_works.png" style="width:45%; margin-left:25%;" /></a></p>

<p>It is clear that, from purely a mental health standpoint, interventions to alleviate
these students’ anxiety are absolutely necessary. But there is a further, more pedagogical
motivation here, too: <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13803395.2015.1066759" target="_blank">anxiety strongly affects academic performance and working memory</a>, so addressing it will both help students
take care of themselves and learn more effectively.</p>

<p>Fortunately, many interventions for other anxiety disorders are shown to work well for students
with math anxiety. Practices rooted in mindfulness, like <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Learning-to-relax%3A-Evaluating-four-brief-for-the-Bruny%C3%A9-Mahoney/6899536c95f528308ab27810cfd17f4ba3a96d9e" target="_blank">focused breathing exercises</a> have been shown to both allay students’ fears about math and improve their performance on math assignments.</p>

<p>There are lots of structured breathing exercises that have been shown to alleviate anxiety, such as guided visualizations (like keeping an imaginary feather aloft with your breath) and four-corner or tactical breathing: breathe in for four seconds, hold for four seconds, breathe out for four seconds, hold for four seconds.</p>

<p>I really like four-corner breathing because it’s a quick and easy way to ground yourself, and it’s especially easy to implement while you’re in the middle of something stressful and time-sensitive, like a math test. Meanwhile, guided visualizations or guided meditation can be good to do as a class before a test. In fact, any of these strategies can be something we learn and do as a class; you don’t have to have an anxiety disorder to experience anxiety, and these tools can come in clutch for anyone in a stressful situation.</p>

<p>Some of my favorite resources on mindfulness and breathing exercises are <a href="https://www.stopbreathethink.com/" target="_blank">Stop, Breathe &amp; Think</a>, which has kid-friendly meditations and many resources for educators, and <a href="https://copingskillsforkids.com/" target="_blank">Coping Skills for Kids</a>, developed by a children’s counselor.</p>

<p>Students with very strong math anxiety should absolutely speak with the school counselor and/or a therapist specializing in anxiety for other coping tools. Good anxiety treatment is really all about building a toolbox with lots of strategies to deploy when things get hairy, and the strategies I’ve mentioned, while often effective, are definitely not one-size-fits-all. As a well-intentioned non-expert with personal experience with mindfulness practices, I can introduce some of these techniques into my classroom, but they are more stop-gap measures to help students cope while they seek treatment for the underlying issues.</p>

<h2 id="math-anxiety-expressive-journaling">Math anxiety: expressive journaling.</h2>
<p>Journaling is another great tool used in treating all kinds emotional disorders, including anxiety disorders. And expressive journaling <a href="https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/voices.uchicago.edu/dist/8/1250/files/2018/07/Park-Ramirez-Beilock-2014-The-role-of-expressive-writing-in-math-anxiety-1yillb0.pdf" target="_blank">has been shown</a> to be very effective for math anxiety. I’d love to use expressive journaling in my classroom, and that paper is a really neat read.</p>

<p>The authors told student volunteers that they were about to take a math test, and asked students to “write as openly as possible about your thoughts and feelings regarding the math problems you are about to perform…. really let yourself go and explore your emotions and thoughts…. Please try to be as open as possible as you write.” They then allowed students to freewrite for seven minutes before they completed the test.</p>

<p>Of the students with math anxiety, those who were highly expressive about their anxiety had higher performance gains than those who used less specific language, and all of those who journaled did better than those who did not. This suggests that emotional honesty is key to this process; so if I implement this, I’ll emphasize that to my students, and make sure they know that <em>no one</em> will read their journals, so they can feel free to be as honest as possible.</p>

<p>I’m thrilled by this journaling intervention for few reasons. First, it’s a good intervention for math anxiety; second, it’s a good way to work some writing into my class; and third, it’s a really good way to get my kids to be honest with themselves and their emotions, which is so healthy, and so hard for teenagers! It’s an important life skill that builds resilience, and I want my students to be able to transition into college life and adulthood as smoothly as possible.</p>
