I"Ù<p>##Structure
Iâ€™m getting my teaching license while also getting an MS in Geosciences, and Iâ€™ve been thinking a lot about structure, because grad school has approximately zero structure, and I miss it so much. I would really have benefitted from more hard deadlines and tough love from my adviser, so as a teacher, I want to make sure I provide that for my students. Having that structure around lets students focus more on their actual learning, rather than all the organizational peripherals to learning. And as a teacher, I also will want some structure, because I do not want chaos with a hundred kidsâ€™ worth of late assignments.</p>

<p>I think a clear routine with direct instruction is ideal, and lots of methods to streamline all the administrativia would be awesome. I want to teach physics, and there is no good way to teach or learn physics that doesnâ€™t involve a ton of diligent work, because itâ€™s lots of new math and lots of new science. So the longer we can spend doing the hard work of learning, the better. But that means that weâ€™ll have to establish some really clear routines and procedures, so we can quickly get down to business.</p>

<p>I taught physics for a year right after undergrad, and I was so lax about deadlines and late work, because my outlook at that point was, â€œAs long as you do the work, then youâ€™ll learn, so better late than never.â€ And while most of my students did do their work on time, a couple just turned in everything way late. Like end-of-year late. So now my outlook on late work is less naive. I did tell them that if they donâ€™t keep on top of their work, they will fall behind and it will take even more work to recover, but (1) some kids donâ€™t really care about physics, and (2) some kids have a hard time with planning, organization, and executive function. If a student falls into camp 1, then theyâ€™re wrong, of course, but thatâ€™s really more my problem than theirs. I canâ€™t make them care about physics, but I can make them learn it. Thatâ€™s my one job. And if a student falls into camp 2, then itâ€™s incumbent upon me to help them develop their planning and organization skills. If I fail to do that, Iâ€™m letting them down. So either way, this means I need to get mean about deadlines. Thatâ€™s the kind of unfun structure that I donâ€™t really look forward to providing, but I know I have to.</p>

<p>##Encouragement and Feedback
Iâ€™m also constantly thinking about encouragement procedures, because thatâ€™s a big deal in physics: tons of the physics education research out there is just about motivating kids to take physics and to stay in physics. I want to get my kids comfortable failing publicly, because thatâ€™s just part of the deal. They will have to do problems on the board and they will mess up. And I will mess up too, because public math in the morning is a recipe for disaster. So Iâ€™ll model graceful, instructive failure, because thatâ€™s built into the job. I also want to incorporate intentional practices to get my students okay with putting themselves out there and risking failure, but I donâ€™t know what that would be yet.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m big into private praise, because that way I can be honest and specific about what Iâ€™m seeing from students without letting everyone else in on anyoneâ€™s private business. So, if a student was having a terrible time with conservation of momentum problems, and then does well on their homework, I can give them feedback specific to that without making it a public event.</p>

<p>Like <a href="http://www.safeandcivilschools.com/services/classroom_management.php" target="_blank">Sprick and friends</a>, I am also all about specific feedback, be it positive, negative, or neutral. Specificity makes praise about a studentâ€™s accomplishments rather than pleasing the teacher, and I think it makes the negative interactions more akin to gentle corrections, and therefore more palatable to a student.</p>

<p>Every mid-quarter and end-of-quarter, I might do student conferences where I make sure I find genuine, positive stuff to note for everyone. Not sure when I would do that (maybe while students are busy with independent work, I guess?) but I definitely want to do mini performance reviewsâ€”especially mid-quarter so students have time to turn things around if they need to.</p>

<p>I tend toward the wildly enthusiastic when lecturing, and Iâ€™m big into rewarding successful struggle, so I foresee a lot of high fives. And successful struggle is, I think, its own reward. You worked really hard and it paid off.</p>

<p>So I guess to sum up my classroom management philosophy: provide structure and organization; donâ€™t be afraid to get on studentsâ€™ cases about doing their work; be positive and roll with the punches, and teach my students to do the same.</p>
