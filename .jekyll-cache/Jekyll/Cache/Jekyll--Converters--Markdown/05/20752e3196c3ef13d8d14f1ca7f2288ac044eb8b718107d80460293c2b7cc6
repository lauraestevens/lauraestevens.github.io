I"“<p>Oh my God, Dr. Blakely, this was an amazing semester. It has been just an incredible experience since day one, when I met my boyfriend for dinner after class and told him I was leaving him for you. He was very understanding about it.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d say the overarching theme of this class was really about how to act on your compassion. Weâ€™re all here because we care about kids and we care about learning, but how we specifically do that, and do that consistently for all students, is not always obvious, and involves rolling with the punches a <em>lot.</em> And self-educating <em><strong>a lot</strong></em>.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m going to start this by saying
I think my biggest takeaway is that direct instruction is truly the tits, regardless of whatever happens to be trendy in education. That seems to be a thing in education, where well-meaning administrators get all hot-and-bothered about something flashy that they heard about on NPR, like discovery learning. â€œTheyâ€™ll learn science by experimenting! How cool is that!â€ No! Not cool! Because they donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re doing!</p>

<p>The year that I taught was the year that that <em>Grit</em> book* came out. Good lord. Malcome Gladwell lost his shit over it (as he does all non-fiction books with one-word titles, I assume) so our administrators made us have a whole PD day about it. We were supposed to, like, teach grit? Which was easy enough for me because I taught college-level** algebra-based physics to students who were just starting Algebra II, where the teachers were made to use a discovery learning curriculum. So it was like, â€œGet used to failure, kids! Letâ€™s have fun!â€</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s another soapbox thing for me, that wild experimentation with your studentsâ€™ learning regardless of what the data says works. I ended up running my classes with a pretty standard direct instruction approach: bellringer, lecture, practice, regroup. They learned physics.</p>

<p>This leads me to another big takeaway. There is a <em>ton</em> that a teacher can do to â€¦ shield their students from the fallout of a poorly-managed school. But a really consistently good education comes from teachers who can manage their classrooms, and administrators who can manage their schools. My mother saysâ€”and remember that sheâ€™s an instructional design person so sheâ€™s biasedâ€”that education people tend to be either design folks, who focus on the data of what methods are really effective and then use those methods, or</p>

** They told me to teach at that level, and then said, â€œTeach to the top 20% and the remaining 80% will fail or switch schools.â€ They also didnâ€™t realize that you needed to have learned all of high-school math to succeed in college physics.</li>
