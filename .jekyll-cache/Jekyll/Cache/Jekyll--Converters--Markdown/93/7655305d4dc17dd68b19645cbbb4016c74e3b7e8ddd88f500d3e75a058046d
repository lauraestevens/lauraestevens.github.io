I"_<p>To sum up my classroom management philosophy: provide structure, clear deadlines, and organization, be positive and roll with the punches, and teach my students to do the same.</p>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>I finished my teaching program while also getting an MS in Geosciences, which served to crystallize my thoughts on the value of structure, because grad school has approximately none.</p>

<p>A clear routine with direct instruction is ideal, and methods to streamline recordkeeping and administration are essential. One subject I love to teach is physics, and there is no good way to teach or learn physics that doesn’t involve a ton of diligent work, because it’s lots of new math and lots of new science. So the longer we can spend doing the hard work of learning, the better. But that means that we’ll have to establish some really clear routines and procedures, so we can quickly get down to business.</p>

<p>I taught physics for a year right after undergrad, and I didn’t closely enforce deadlines and late work, because my outlook at that point was, “As long as you do the work, then you’ll learn, so better late than never.” And while most of my students did do their work on time, a couple just turned in everything <em>way</em> late. After giving it some thought, I realized those students probably fell into one of two camps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>They didn’t really care about physics, so they didn’t have the intrinsic motivation to get the work done.</li>
  <li>They had a hard time with planning, organization, and executive function.</li>
</ol>

<p>If a student falls into camp 1, I need to find ways to motivate them. That’s my job. And if a student falls into camp 2, then it’s incumbent upon me to help them develop their planning and organization skills. If I fail to do that, I’m letting them down.</p>

<p>So either way, this means I need to get consistent and serious about deadlines. It also means I can offer my students specific methods of recordkeeping and organization, like using <a href="https://www.calacademy.org/educators/science-notebook-corner">science notebooks</a>.</p>

<h2 id="encouragement-and-failure">Encouragement and Failure</h2>
<p>Most students are guaranteed to struggle in some aspect of their academic lives, and that can be really discouraging, especially if you’re at either extreme. If you consistently struggle in classes no matter how hard you work, it can be so tempting to just stop trying. And if school has always come easy to you and you’re finding yourself struggling for the first time, that’s quite a shock!</p>

<p>But struggling is part of learning, and failing can be instructional. That’s where encouragement comes in: I need to encourage my kids to power through the struggle and learn.</p>

<p>So I want to get my kids comfortable with failure, including public failure, because that’s just part of the deal. They will have to do problems on the board and they will mess up. And I will mess up too, because public math in the morning is a recipe for disaster. So I’ll model graceful, instructive failure, because that’s built into the job.</p>

<p>I also want to incorporate intentional practices to get my students okay with putting themselves out there and risking failure. I have used a wheel of names and Dungeons and Dragons dice to facilitate random cold-calling. When students are put on the spot like that, they are definitely uncomfortable at first, but once they realize that getting out there and guessing is actually productive rather than world-ending, it gets a lot easier for them, and they start volunteering their best guesses.</p>

<p>All of this small-scale exposure to failure leads to our ultimate goal: students who can design their own experiments, gather data, and do science on their own. They may not feel confident about it at first, but every day they will be learning the importance of guessing and failing, and how integral it is to the process of science. Project-based learning is the ultimate culmination of that, and while I don’t believe that good science teaching should be entirely PBL (nor should it be entirely direct instruction), it is still an essential component. And it’s an incredibly empowering component, as long as students aren’t immediately thrown into the deep end.</p>

<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>
<p>I’m big into private praise, because that way I can be honest and specific about what I’m seeing from students without letting everyone else in on anyone’s private business. So, if a student was having a terrible time with conservation of momentum problems, and then does well on their homework, I can give them feedback specific to that without making it a public event.</p>

<p>Like <a href="http://www.safeandcivilschools.com/services/classroom_management.php" target="_blank">Sprick and friends</a>, I am also big into specific feedback, be it positive, negative, or neutral. Specificity makes praise about a student’s accomplishments rather than pleasing the teacher, and I think it makes the negative interactions more akin to gentle corrections, and therefore more palatable to a student.</p>

<p>I tend toward the wildly enthusiastic when lecturing, and I’m big into rewarding successful struggle, so I foresee a lot of high fives when we’re all allowed to touch again. And successful struggle is, I think, its own reward. You worked really hard and it paid off.</p>
