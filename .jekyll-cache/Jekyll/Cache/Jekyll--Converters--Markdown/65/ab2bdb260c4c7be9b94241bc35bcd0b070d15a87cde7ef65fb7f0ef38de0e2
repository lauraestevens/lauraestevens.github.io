I"Y<p>I’m Laura, and I’m very excited to be here! I’m finishing my licensure to teach secondary science (broadfield w/physics focus), and my masters degree in geosciences, looking at the formation of the oldest fossils. I can’t wait to student teach in spring 2021!</p>

<p>My broadest educational goals are</p>
<ol>
  <li>to help students develop their self-advocacy and self-care skills,</li>
  <li>to make science exciting and accessible to all students, and</li>
  <li>to ensure that all my students graduate with the strong scientific literacy that will empower them as citizens.</li>
</ol>
