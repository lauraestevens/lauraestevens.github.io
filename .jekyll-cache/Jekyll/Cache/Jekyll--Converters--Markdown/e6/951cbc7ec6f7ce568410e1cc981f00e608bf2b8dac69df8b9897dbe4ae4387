I"Œ<p>This is one of <em>the most important</em> things for me. I am <em>so serious</em> about educational accessibility. Like, I start getting angry about it. Itâ€™s a civil rights issue! We canâ€™t just ignore the <em>rights of children</em>! Of <em><strong>children!</strong></em></p>

<p>â€¦. Okay. Iâ€™m better now. Here are some ways to approach students with learning disabilities or other special educational needs. Because Iâ€™ll be teaching science, my focus will be on accommodating students in science classes, and because physics is so math-intensive, math learning disabilities and math anxiety is a special interest of mine.</p>

<h2 id="math-ld-manipulatives">Math LD: Manipulatives</h2>
<p>All students learning any math will benefit from manipulatives, or objects used to represent mathematical concepts. These can be as simple as beans reprensenting numbers, to 3D-printed projections of extradimensional shapes. They are essentially mathâ€™s answer to models in science: think of the ball-and-stick models of chemical compounds.</p>

<p>Manipulatives have been shown to provide <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1540-5826.00067?casa_token=_PanHH0eg0wAAAAA%3AKvqG2zSFbis4UQWJKNs9GkVpHJFBSpFfZjdi9PRrSt5abrlG39FdvxVir3gR16Cg-FHRDL3vus4vPLhG" target="_blank">long-term gains in mathematical ability</a>; however, using them effectively requires extra effort from
teachers, and may even require special training or meeting with a specialist.</p>

<p>For instance, students with DD tend to have difficulty subitizing, or breaking
quantities down into groups. So, if a student presented with two
groups of five beans, they would need to count each individual bean to say that there are
ten there. It is not enough to present them with two groups of five beans, to give them
manipulatives; how that lesson is run, and how the knowledge is assessed and reinforced, is
the most important factor.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are a great deal of resources to make manipulative use accessible and widespread. The
companies that make the manipulatives have lesson plans to accompany them, and
websites like <a href="https://mathforlove.com/" target="_blank">Math for Love</a> and <a href="https://www.nctm.org/" target="_blank">National Council of Teachers of Mathematics</a>
have further resources on theory and implementation. There are manipulatives that look
like money; there are manipulatives designed specifically to teach place value, fractions,
addition, and subtraction; there are virtual manipulatives, such as <a href="https://www.nctm.org/">NumberBeads</a>, in which students can drag, drop, slice, and meld strings of beads to
develop their ability to subitize. Because of the wide variety of manipulatives, there is no
one way to implement them, so it is important that teachers familiarize themselves with
the specific manipulatives they plan to use and are conscientious as they plan their lessons
with them.</p>
