<p>Open communication between parents, students, and school is extremely important. And with that sentence, I have won first prize in the <em>Tell Us Something We <strong>Donâ€™t</strong> Know!</em> contest; thank you so much for all your support!</p>

<p>But I do care a great deal about keeping parents abreast of whatâ€™s going on in school, because</p>
<ol>
  <li>Parents probably want to know what their children are up to. Are they happy? Are they working hard? Are they learning? Thatâ€™s the whole point of being alive! Parents want to know that their children are all right!</li>
  <li>If parents donâ€™t want to know that, then thatâ€™s probably something I should be aware of too! Communication gives me a window into my studentsâ€™ home lives.</li>
  <li>Having established a good relationship by communicating all the awesome stuff a student has been doing will make it easier for parents to hear from me when their student is missing several assignments or has behaved inappropriately.</li>
</ol>

<p>We are really all of us â€” parents, students, and teachers â€” in a partnership, and uneven communication in a partnership doesnâ€™t lead to healthy dynamics.</p>

<p>So here are some ways I could keep channels of communication open with both parents and students:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Introductory postcards/emailsâ€”one to each student, one to their parents/guardians. It will read something like this:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Ms. Stevens, and Iâ€™ll be teaching (you/your child) physics/earth science/what-have-you this year. Iâ€™m very excited to get to know (you/you and your child) and I look forward to a great year! If you ever need to get in contact with me, hereâ€™s how to do so â€¦.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Bi-weekly informal report cards for students, mostly to let them know if theyâ€™re missing assignments. Depending on the studentâ€™s age and situation, it may be necessary to loop parents in as well: middle schoolers may need some extra help at home on keeping up with assignments, but for high schoolers, itâ€™s time to transfer some of that responsibility.</li>
  <li>Calls home for especially big deals â€” both good and bad! Averaging a D because you have so many missing assignments gets a call home, but so does getting more than a 98% on a test. Maybe 95% in a physics class, because physics is hard.</li>
</ol>

<p>Iâ€™d also like to address communication by action. I will go to all my studentsâ€™ games, even though sports are boring; I will go to their plays and concerts; Iâ€™ll go to their Magic: The Gathering tournaments if they tell me about them. Showing up for kids does so much to build trust, and thatâ€™s really the core purpose of communication.</p>
