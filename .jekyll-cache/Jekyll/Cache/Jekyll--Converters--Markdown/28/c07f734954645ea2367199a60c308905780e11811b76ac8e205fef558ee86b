I"Ÿ<p>Open communication between parents, students, and school is extremely important. And with that sentence, I have won first prize in the <em>Tell Us Something We <strong>Donâ€™t</strong> Know!</em> contest; thank you so much for all your support!</p>

<p>But I do care a great deal about keeping parents abreast of whatâ€™s going on in school, because</p>
<ol>
  <li>Parents probably want to know what their children are up to. Are they happy? Are they working hard? Are they learning? Thatâ€™s the whole point of being alive! Parents want to know that their children are all right!</li>
  <li>If parents donâ€™t want to know that, then thatâ€™s probably something I should be aware of too! Communication gives me a window into my studentsâ€™ home lives.</li>
  <li>Having established a good relationship by communicating all the awesome stuff a student has been doing will make it easier for parents to hear from me when their student is missing several assignments or has behaved inappropriately.</li>
</ol>

<p>We are really all of us â€” parents, students, and teachers â€” in a partnership, and uneven communication in a partnership doesnâ€™t lead to healthy dynamics.</p>

<p>So here are some ways Iâ€™d keep channels of communication open with both parents and students:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Introductory postcards! One to each student, one to their parents/guardians. It will read something like this:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Ms. Stevens, and Iâ€™ll be teaching (you/your child) physics/earth science/what-have-you this year. Iâ€™m very excited to get to know (you/you and your child) and I look forward to a great year! If you ever need to get in contact with me, hereâ€™s how to do so â€¦.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>Bi-weekly informal report cards, mostly just to let parents know if everything is okay. If a student is missing more than two assignments, this is where Iâ€™d make note of that. Iâ€™d also include a summary of what we just did and where weâ€™re going, along with important dates/deadlines.</li>
  <li>Calls home for especially big deals â€” both good and bad! Missing more than three assignments gets a call home, but so does getting more than a 98% on a test. Maybe 95% in a physics class, because physics is hard.</li>
  <li>Every quarter, a personalized letter, one to each student and one to their parents/guardians. Studentsâ€™ letters would be a place to encourage them; parentsâ€™ letters would be a place to let them know in some more detail how their students are doing.</li>
</ol>

<p>And just for students, some of these practices might be effective:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Weekly mini-reports, with your current grade, any missing assignments, and a quick note of encouragement.</li>
  <li>Open office hours, maybe during lunch or for the first hour or so after school, to come check in, get some homework help, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Iâ€™d also like to address communication by action. I will go to all my studentsâ€™ games, even though sports are boring; I will go to their plays and concerts; Iâ€™ll go to their Magic: The Gathering tournaments if they tell me about them. Showing up for kids does so much to build trust, and thatâ€™s really the core purpose of communication.</p>
