I"à<p>To sum up my classroom management philosophy: provide structure, clear deadlines, and organization, be positive and roll with the punches, and teach my students to do the same.</p>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>
<p>I finished my teaching program while also getting an MS in Geosciences, which served to crystallize my thoughts on the value of structure, because grad school has approximately none.</p>

<p>A clear routine with direct instruction is ideal, and methods to streamline recordkeeping and administration would be helpful. I want to teach physics, and there is no good way to teach or learn physics that doesn‚Äôt involve a ton of diligent work, because it‚Äôs lots of new math and lots of new science. So the longer we can spend doing the hard work of learning, the better. But that means that we‚Äôll have to establish some really clear routines and procedures, so we can quickly get down to business.</p>

<p>I taught physics for a year right after undergrad, and I didn‚Äôt closely enforce deadlines and late work, because my outlook at that point was, ‚ÄúAs long as you do the work, then you‚Äôll learn, so better late than never.‚Äù And while most of my students did do their work on time, a couple just turned in everything <em>way</em> late. After giving it some thought, I realized those students probably fell into one of two camps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>They didn‚Äôt really care about physics, so they didn‚Äôt have the intrinsic motivation to get the work done.</li>
  <li>They had a hard time with planning, organization, and executive function.</li>
</ol>

<p>If a student falls into camp 1, I need to find ways to motivate them. That‚Äôs my job. And if a student falls into camp 2, then it‚Äôs incumbent upon me to help them develop their planning and organization skills. If I fail to do that, I‚Äôm letting them down.</p>

<p>So either way, this means I need to get consistent and serious about deadlines.</p>

<h2 id="encouragement-and-feedback">Encouragement and Feedback</h2>
<p>I‚Äôm also constantly thinking about encouragement procedures, because that‚Äôs a big deal in physics: tons of the physics education research out there is just about motivating kids to take physics and to stay in physics. And that can be difficult to do when physics is hard. Most students are guaranteed to struggle in physics, and that can be really discouraging. So it‚Äôs not just a question of motivating students to take an interest in physics, it‚Äôs a question of motivating students to stick with it even when it gets hard.</p>

<p>I want to get my kids comfortable failing publicly, because that‚Äôs just part of the deal. They will have to do problems on the board and they will mess up. And I will mess up too, because public math in the morning is a recipe for disaster. So I‚Äôll model graceful, instructive failure, because that‚Äôs built into the job. I also want to incorporate intentional practices to get my students okay with putting themselves out there and risking failure, but I don‚Äôt know what that would be yet.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm big into private praise, because that way I can be honest and specific about what I‚Äôm seeing from students without letting everyone else in on anyone‚Äôs private business. So, if a student was having a terrible time with conservation of momentum problems, and then does well on their homework, I can give them feedback specific to that without making it a public event.</p>

<p>Like <a href="http://www.safeandcivilschools.com/services/classroom_management.php" target="_blank">Sprick and friends</a>, I am also all about specific feedback, be it positive, negative, or neutral. Specificity makes praise about a student‚Äôs accomplishments rather than pleasing the teacher, and I think it makes the negative interactions more akin to gentle corrections, and therefore more palatable to a student.</p>

<p>Every mid-quarter and end-of-quarter, I might do student conferences where I make sure I find genuine, positive stuff to note for everyone. Not sure when I would do that (maybe while students are busy with independent work, I guess?) but I definitely want to do mini performance reviews‚Äîespecially mid-quarter, so students have time to turn things around if they need to.</p>

<p>I tend toward the wildly enthusiastic when lecturing, and I‚Äôm big into rewarding successful struggle, so I foresee a lot of high fives. And successful struggle is, I think, its own reward. You worked really hard and it paid off.</p>
