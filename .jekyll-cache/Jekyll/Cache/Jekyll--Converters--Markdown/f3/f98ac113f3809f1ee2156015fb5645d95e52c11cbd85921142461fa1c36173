I"ü<p>Iâ€™m Laura, and Iâ€™m very excited to be here! I am a Montana educator teaching secondary science (broadfield w/physics focus), with a passion for space science and biology.</p>

<p>My broadest educational goals are</p>
<ol>
  <li>to help students develop their self-advocacy and self-care skills,</li>
  <li>to make science exciting and accessible to all students, and</li>
  <li>to ensure that all my students graduate with the strong scientific literacy that will empower them as citizens.</li>
</ol>
