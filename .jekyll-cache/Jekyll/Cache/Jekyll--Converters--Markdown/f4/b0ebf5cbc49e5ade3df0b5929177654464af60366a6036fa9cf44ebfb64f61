I"¢<p>Iâ€™m Laura, and Iâ€™m very excited to be here! Iâ€™m finishing my licensure to teach secondary science (broadfield w/physics focus), and my masters degree in geosciences, looking at the formation of the oldest fossils.</p>

<p>My broadest educational goals are to help students develop their self-advocacy and self-care skills, to make science exciting and accessible to all students, and ensure that all my students graduate with strong scientific literacy to empower them as citizens.</p>
