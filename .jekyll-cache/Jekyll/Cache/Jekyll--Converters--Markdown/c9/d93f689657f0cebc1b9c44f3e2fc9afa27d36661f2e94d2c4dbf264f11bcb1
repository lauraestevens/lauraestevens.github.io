I"Õ<p>Oh my God, Dr. Blakely, this was an amazing semester. It has been just an incredible experience since day one, when I met my boyfriend for dinner after class and told him I was leaving him for you. He was very understanding about it.</p>

<p>I‚Äôd say the overarching theme of this class was really about how to act on your compassion. We‚Äôre all here because we care about kids and we care about learning, but how we specifically do that, and do that consistently for all students, is not always obvious, and involves rolling with the punches a <em>lot.</em> And self-educating <em><strong>a lot</strong></em>. And, less fun but wildly necessary, is sometimes being the bad guy. Enforcing rules and structure is not fun. But being the adult in the room means not always being fun. It means being there, being stable, and being trustworthy.</p>

<p>Okay, so now I‚Äôm going to go grab my soapbox and megaphone from the Accommodations section because my other big takeaways need them for maximum effect.</p>

<p>I also learned that direct instruction is truly the tits, regardless of whatever happens to be trendy in education. That seems to be a thing in education, where well-meaning administrators get all hot-and-bothered about something flashy that they heard about on NPR, like discovery learning. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôll learn science by experimenting! How cool is that!‚Äù No! Not cool! Because they don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing!</p>

<p>The year that I taught was the year that that <em>Grit</em> book* came out. Good lord. Malcom Gladwell lost his shit over it (as he does all non-fiction books with one-word titles, I assume) so our administrators made us have a whole PD day about it. We were supposed to, like, teach grit? Which was easy enough for me because I taught college-level** algebra-based physics to students who were just starting Algebra II, where the teachers were made to use a discovery learning curriculum. So it was like, ‚ÄúGet used to failure, kids! Let‚Äôs have fun!‚Äù</p>

<p>That‚Äôs another soapbox thing for me, that experimentation with your students‚Äô learning regardless of what the data says works. I ended up running my classes with a pretty standard direct instruction approach: bellringer, lecture, practice, regroup. They learned physics. And it wasn‚Äôt a great</p>

<p>This leads me to another big takeaway. There is a <em>ton</em> that a teacher can do to ‚Ä¶ shield their students from the fallout of a poorly-managed school. But a really consistently good education comes from teachers who can manage their classrooms, and administrators who can manage their schools. Like, hearing about Hellgate compared to my teaching experience, or my boyfriend‚Äôs educational experience at other Missoula schools which I shall not name,</p>

<p>And some of that just comes down to resources: it would be great if you had a big administrative and counseling team for all your IEP kids, but that‚Äôs not always the case. It would be great if you had a counselor. Like, a school counselor. One. Just one. Not every school has that. And if your school is struggling and you‚Äôre hiring new administrators, let‚Äôs hope your school is struggling despite being in a rich area, because good teachers and good administrators are ultimately resources. Caring about kids and wanting the best for all of them doesn‚Äôt negate you or your</p>

<p class="caption">** They told me to teach at that level, and then said, "Teach to the top 20% and the remaining 80% will fail or switch schools." They also didn't realize that you needed to have learned all of high-school math to succeed in college physics. &lt;/a&gt;
