I'm Laura, and I'm very excited to be here! I am a Montana educator teaching secondary science (broadfield w/physics focus), with a passion for space science and biology.

My broadest educational goals are 
1. to help students develop their self-advocacy and self-care skills, 
2. to make science exciting and accessible to all students, and 
3. to ensure that all my students graduate with the strong scientific literacy that will empower them as citizens.
