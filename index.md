title: Laura Likes to Teach!

I'm Laura, and I'm very excited to be here! I'm finishing my licensure to teach secondary science (broadfield w/physics focus), and my masters degree in geosciences, looking at the formation of the oldest fossils.

My broadest educational goals are to make science exciting and accessible to all students, and ensure that all my students graduate with strong scientific literacy to empower them as citizens.
