I'm Laura, and I'm very excited to be here! I am certified in the state of Montana to teach secondary science (broadfield w/physics focus), and currently work in [the physics department at Gonzaga University](https://www.gonzaga.edu/college-of-arts-sciences/departments/physics/staff) as a lab specialist, teaching an introductory physics course to non-STEM majors.

My broadest educational goals are 
1. to help students develop their self-advocacy and self-care skills, 
2. to make science exciting and accessible to all students, and 
3. to ensure that all my students graduate with the strong scientific literacy that will empower them as citizens.
