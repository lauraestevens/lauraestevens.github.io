title: Laura Likes to Teach!

I'm Laura, and I'm very excited to be here! I'm finishing my licensure to teach secondary science (broadfield w/physics focus), and my masters degree in geosciences, looking at the formation of the oldest fossils. I can't wait to student teach in spring 2021!

My broadest educational goals are 
1. to help students develop their self-advocacy and self-care skills, 
2. to make science exciting and accessible to all students, and 
3. to ensure that all my students graduate with the strong scientific literacy that will empower them as citizens.
