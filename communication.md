title: Communication
---
Open communication between parents, students, and school is extremely important. And with that sentence, I have won first prize in the _Tell Us Something We **Don't** Know!_ contest; thank you so much for all your support!

But keeping parents abreast of what's going on in school is super important to me, because
1. Parents probably want to know what their children are up to. Are they happy? Are they working hard? Are they learning? That's the whole point of being alive! Parents want to know that their children are all right!
2. If parents don't want to know that, then that's probably something I should be aware of too! Communication gives me a window into my students' home lives.
3. Having established a good relationship by communicating all the awesome stuff a student has been doing will make it easier for parents to hear from me when their student is missing three assignments or dropped the f-bomb or what have you. 

We are really all of us --- parents, students, and teachers --- in a partnership, and uneven communication in a partnership doesn't lead to healthy dynamics. 

So here are some ways I'd keep channels of communication open with both parents and students:
1. Introductory postcards! One to each student, one to their parents/guardians. It will read something like this:
> Hello! I'm Ms. Stevens, and I'll be teaching (you/your child) physics/earth science/what-have-you this year. I'm very excited to get to know (you/you and your child) and I look forward to a great year! If you ever need to get in contact with me, here's how to do so .... 
3. Bi-weekly informal report cards, mostly just to let parents know if everything is okay. If a student is missing more than two assignments, this is where I'd make note of that. I'd also include a summary of what we just did and where we're going, along with important dates/deadlines. 
4. Calls home for especially big deals --- both good and bad! Missing more than three assignments gets a call home, but so does getting more than a 98% on a test. Maybe 95% in a physics class, because physics is hard.
5. Every quarter, a personalized letter, one to each student and one to their parents/guardians. Students' letters would be a place to encourage them; parents' letters would be a place to let them know in some more detail how their students are doing. 

And just for students, some of these practices might be effective:
1. Weekly mini-reports, with your current grade, any missing assignments, and a quick note of encouragement. 
2. Open office hours, maybe during lunch or for the first hour or so after school, to come check in, get some homework help, etc. 

I'd also like to address communication by action. I would go to all my students' games, even though sports are boring; I'd go to their plays and concerts; I'd go to their Magic: The Gathering tournaments if they told me about them. Showing up for kids does so much to build trust, and that's really the core purpose of communication.
